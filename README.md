## Hi there 👋
I'm Fatima, an Undergrad Student based in the United States double majoring in Mathematics and Electrical Engineering. 

I'm a beginner in STEM and higher Education learning through my College, self-driven projects, GitHub, VS Code and other platforms. I made this account to serve as a portfolio to document my growth, experiment with new topics, develop my skills, and encourage other students from diverse backgrounds and all stages of learning to create their own paths in STEM. No matter how daunting it may seem at the beginning. 

A little bit of Background: 
I used Code.org in elementary and middle school as part of my computer literacy classes but I struggled a lot. Then I took 2 required computer classes in high school and again I didn't like them a lot. Now I am in College and I am giving coding another chance. I've come to appreciate the work of my computer science professors and despite also struggling in my introductory Java class in college, I am exploring language learning on my own and really liking it. In the future I will keep learning languages and see where that gets me either professionally or personally. Either way, there is always room for growth!
